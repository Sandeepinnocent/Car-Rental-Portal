Description of project :-As we know that EVs are environmental savers but the adoption rate is relatively low. So to boost the adoption rate the user need to experience the vehicle driving. To get the experience of EV to the user the rental service is one of the best practice to implement. By this the user gets to know the benefits of EVs like 
Pocket friendly then vehicles which are run on fossil fuel, safer to environment, no sound pollution. This all are adopt by experiencing the vehicle. Even though it is hard to noise vehicles to silent vehicles we also include petrol and diesel vehicles to sustain the rental service in initial times.

Problem statement:
 Increasing environmental concerns  the need for sustainable transportation solutions the urgent requirement to shift from traditional fossil fuel vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs). Benefits that EVs offer, such as reduced carbon emissions and lower operational costs, the adoption rate remains relatively low. This challenge underscores the necessity for effective strategies to accelerate the widespread acceptance and adoption of EVs.
 Solution :
As we know that EVs are environmental savers but the adoption rate is relatively low. So to boost the adoption rate the user need to experience the vehicle driving. To get the experience of EV to the user the rental service is one of the best practice to implement. By this the user gets to know the benefits of EVs like 
Pocket friendly then vehicles which are run on fossil fuel, safer to environment, no sound pollution. This all are adopt by experiencing the vehicle. Even though it is hard to noise vehicles to silent vehicles we also include petrol and diesel vehicles to sustain the rental service in initial times.

Technical implementation: 
To solve this problem we approached to online car rental service, means the customer book the vehicle through our web site and may customer come to location and rent a vehicle or the car comes to the customer place deliver by rental service.
